<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](file:///Users/avniguota/Library/Group%20Containers/group.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp.shared/Message/Media/120363323194693186@g.us/e/2/e2788db1-5716-453f-b247-6c24e0f35922.jpg)

Our project aims to develop a Generative AI agent that creates personalized marketing content based on user preferences, enhancing customer satisfaction and relevance. By utilizing text and image generation capabilities, the solution provides customized marketing materials tailored to retail sellers. The system employs a recommender model powered by reinforcement learning, optimizing product recommendations and adapting to seasonality. Key challenges include the inability to fine-tune the Gemini model for specific applications, difficulties in capturing nuanced user feedback, and ensuring AI-generated content aligns with brand standards. This innovative approach enhances brand connection with users while navigating the complexities of personalized marketing.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started



This project implements two powerful approaches for personalized email marketing:

1. **OpenAI Turbo**: This model enhances personalized email ads by analyzing user data, such as past purchases and preferences, to generate tailored content. It excels in contextual understanding, allowing for dynamic product recommendations and exclusive discounts. Leveraging real-time feedback, OpenAI Turbo refines its recommendations, ensuring relevance and engagement while increasing conversion rates.

2. **Gemini**: The Gemini recommender system elevates email marketing by creating visually appealing ads that reflect user preferences and seasonal trends. By analyzing user behavior, it crafts engaging emails featuring tailored product recommendations and exclusive discounts, fostering brand loyalty and enhancing the overall customer experience.
